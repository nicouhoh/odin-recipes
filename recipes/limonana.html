  <h1>Limonana</h1>
    <img src="https://feelgoodfoodie.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Mint-Lemonade-10b.jpg" alt="Two millenial-compatible mason jars filled with limonana: a luminous, chartreuse elixir, with miniscule dark grass green floaters, generously laden with ice and garnished with a sprig of mint and a slice of lemon each; beside the jars lie the leftovers of the same garnish, placed casually, yet carefully just-so. Beyond the jars, and the cutting board they sit atop, a large pitcher of more limonana waits in the soft-focused distance, promising a future of limitless refreshment forthcoming.">
  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This jubilant refreshment is quaffed throughout the Middle East in the hot months of summer.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3.5 lemons (or 5 limes)</li>
      <li>10g mint leaves</li>
      <li>100-130g sugar</li>
      <li>700ml cold water</li>
      <li>150g ice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Take the lemons, mint leaves, sugar and cold water in hand and sling them into a blender of good whipping power.</li>
      <li>Whir the ingredients at low speed to combine, then excite on the high setting no less than thirty seconds to fully thrash the mint. In this time the mixture should become foamy and powerfully green.</li>
      <li>You may now add more sugar should you desire, and you may add the ice and blend again.</li>
      <li>Pour through a fine strainer and into a glass. Serve cold, over ice.</li>
    </ol>
