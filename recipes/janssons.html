    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Oh how exotic -- Janssons Frestelse, translating to "Jansson's Temptation," is a Swedish Christmastime delight -- warm, creamy, savory -- if you love potatoes, if you love anchovies, if you love to be happy, cooking this must be your very next task.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6tbsp butter</li>
      <li>1 large yellow onion, halved and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>kosher salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 to 2 1/2 lbs potatoes (about 3 or 4 large russets or about 6 large Yukon Gold), scrubbed</li>
      <li>4 to 5 oz tinned spice-cured sprats*, drained and rougly torn, oil reserved</li>
      <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 cup panko</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>* A note for the scrupulous:</h3>
    <p>Don't be fooled -- Swedish versions of this recipe call for "ansjovis," but, flying in the face of all reason, this actually translates to sprats. The spice-cured sprats are less salty and evoke more distinctly the native flavours of that Nordic wonderland, Sweden. If you're going all the way, the most suitable brand to acquire is <em>Abba Grebbestad.</em> For those without the time or care to track down the elusive spiced sprat, <strong>you may substitute 2 oz oil-packed anchovies, and add a pinch each of cinnamon and nutmeg.</strong></p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat the oven to 425°4F. Rub 1 tablespoon of the butter around a 9- to 10-inch deep-dish pie plate or a 2-quart casserole dish.</li>
      <li>Heat 3 tablespoons of the butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onion and sliced garlic, season with salt and pepper, and sauté, stirring regularly, until softened but not browned, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
      <li>Thinly slice the potatoes into ¼-inch-thick matchsticks. Layer a third of the potatoes into the pie plate and season with salt and lots of black pepper. Add half the onions, then scatter over half of the sprats or anchovies. Layer another third of the potatoes, season, then add the remaining onions and anchovies. Add the remaining potatoes and season once more. </li>
      <li>Pour the milk and cream into a small bowl or liquid measuring cup and stir in the cayenne (and cinnamon and nutmeg, if using). Pour this mixture over the casserole (it should come up about three-quarters of the way).</li>
      <li>Top the casserole with the panko. Season with salt and pepper, then dot the remaining butter over the surface. Cover the pie plate tightly with foil.</li>
      <li>Bake the casserole for 45 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown and bubbling. Let cool slightly, then serve on Christmas Eve.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>A confession</h3>
    <p>While this is a dish that I enjoy and hold dear to my heart, I cannot actually vouch for the recipe detailed above. It was stolen without remorse from <a href="https://food52.com/recipes/86076-best-janssons-frestelse-recipe"></a>.</p>
